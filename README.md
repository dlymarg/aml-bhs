# AML-Sp-2018
A collection of Python files that were used in Towson University's Applied Mathematics Laboratory (AML) for the spring 2018 semester. The AML was contracted by the Baltimore Humane Society to evaluate donation history to classify donors, visualize donation data, and understand what factors encourage major donations.

# Geocoding
One of our tasks was to convert a .csv file that consisted of over 20,000 addresses into a set of GPS coordinates. This conversion is known as geocoding. Using the Google Maps API, we were able to geocode over 97% of all addresses provided to us.

In this folder, you will find a sample list of addresses, a Python file that performs the process of geocoding, and output .csv files. Packages required: googlemaps, csv
